SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows
an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.



Some SQL injection examples are:

Adding a boolean to a where clause that is always true like ' OR 1=1
Escaping part of query by entering line comments --
Ending the initial query and start a new query '; DROP TABLE USERS;
Connecting data from multiple tables by using UNION


//SQL injection prevention
Do not rely on client-side input validation
Use a database user with restricted privileges
Use prepared statements and query parameterization
Scan your code for SQL injection vulnerabilities
Use an ORM layer
Donâ€™t rely on blocklisting
Perform input validation
Be careful with stored procedures
